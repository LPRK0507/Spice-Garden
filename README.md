# Spice-Garden

### Context

The "Spice Garden" restaurant had garnered quite a reputation for its delectable and custom-made variety of dishes. It wasn't just the flavors that set The Spice Garden apart; it was their unique approach to customer service.

At The Spice Garden, patrons could place an order for any dish of their choice by simply calling the restaurant. Whether it was a mouthwatering cheese burst pizza or a plate of sizzling noodles, the customers had the freedom to customize their orders to their heart's content. This personalized approach had diners raving about the restaurant far and wide.

To make the ordering process even more convenient, the restaurant decided to embrace modern technology. They developed a user-friendly web application that allowed their call operators to streamline the process. With this application, the operators could easily access the restaurant's menu, enter order details on behalf of the customers, and crucially, persist this information for future reference.

In essence, the restaurant aimed to create a digital system that not only enhanced their customer service but also enabled them to better understand their clientele's preferences and history.

The goal was clear: to develop a JavaScript program that would be the backbone of this system, giving The Spice Garden's call operators the tools they needed to continue providing their patrons with the exceptional, personalized dining experience they had come to expect.


### Problem Statement

Create a JavaScript program that would empower the call operators of the Spice Garden restaurant. This program needed to do several things:
- Allow the operator to view the menu items by categories like "starters", "Main course", "Beverages" and "Desserts".
- Provide an interface for the operator to enter customer details such as name, contact information, delivery address, menu items and their quantity and cost, and calculate the total cost of the order.
- Provide an interface for the operator to reserve a table on behalf of customers for a specified date and time.
- Persist this data for future reference, ensuring that the restaurant could maintain accurate records of orders and customer preferences.
